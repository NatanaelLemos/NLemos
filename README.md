# NLemos Personal Blog

This app is published on: [https://natanael.lemos.dev](https://natanael.lemos.dev)

## Technologies

I know that there are many frameworks and tools for building blogs, but I wish to build my own just for fun.

For this I used:

* .Net Core 2.1.503
* MongoDB
* And for publishing, I'm using Azure DevOps

## ToDo

* Localization apparently isn't working
* Search can only look into the full post content but not title or summary
* Make it generic (removing personal info from hard-coded code)
* Dark mode?
